@WHAT IS TEXT TO SLIDE-@
#It doesn't have a very elaborate name, so the idea is obvious... make Google Presetations using just a plain text-#
@BECAUSE...-@
#We want people don't to spend time thinking about design stuff like dragging images, choosing colors...They should focus just in the content-#
@HOW?-@
#We create a web page (really basic web page) that allow user to upload their .txt file or white directly on the page and transform it to a Google Presentation-#
@WHAT WE USE-@
#HTML5 and PHP7 (also for the Google Slides API)-#
